# 🐾 PyClaw

**Plug-and-play AI agent box for Raspberry Pi.**

Pre-configured [PicoClaw](https://github.com/nichochar/picoclaw) on a Raspberry Pi — ready to run in minutes, no terminal required.

## What is this?

A $150 alternative to buying a $600+ Mac mini just to run an AI agent 24/7. PyClaw gives you:

- ⚡ **Ready out of the box** — plug in power + ethernet, scan QR code, done
- 🤖 **Your own AI agent** — running 24/7 on hardware you own
- 🔒 **Private & local** — your data stays on your device
- 💰 **Affordable** — fraction of the cost of a Mac mini setup

## How It Works

1. **Plug in** your PyClaw box (power + ethernet or WiFi)
2. **Scan the QR code** on the device
3. **Follow the setup wizard** (connect your AI provider, set your name)
4. **Done** — your AI agent is running

## What's Inside

- Raspberry Pi 5 (4GB)
- Pre-flashed SD card with PyClaw OS
- PicoClaw (lightweight Go-based AI agent runtime)
